	<p>Students will create a Dr. Seuss-related game, whether a board game or a card game. The group must create and write down the rules and game directions as well as create the game board, etc. Thicker material like poster board or large card stock should be used for boards and/or cards. Students may use pieces (like dice or character tokens) from other games if necessary. Game ideas include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Board Game - Sam-I-Am trying to get his friend to eat Green Eggs and Ham</li>
		<li>Board Game - The Lorax trying to stop his trees from getting cut down</li>
		<li>Board Game - The Grinch trying to steal Christmas</li>
		<li>Card Game - Utilizing <i>Fox in Socks/Oh Say Can You Say</i> tongue twisters</li>
		<li>Card Game - Creating <i>If I Ran the Zoo</i>-type animals and a Zookeeper choosing which one to take from the group per round</li>
		<li>Card Game - A <i>What Was I Scared of?</i> guessing game</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The final presentation must be at least <b>3-5 minutes</b> to explain how the game works and with a brief demonstration (an entire playthrough is not necessary).</p>
