	<p>Dr. Seuss is one of the most influential and well-known children's authors and illustrators. This website will teach how to create a transmedia storytelling project about Dr. Seuss and his works.</p>
	<p>Transmedia Storytelling is the telling of one story, topic, theme, or concept across various media, such as video, text, imagery, music, gaming, and social media. When all media come together, a complete picture is given on the subject. These types of projects allow for small groups to research and learn about a specific area of the topic, ideally within a media method (i.e. music or video) each group is interested in, and teach it to the rest of the class. Once the entire class has presented, the "picture" will be complete. The role of the teacher, then, is to facilitate and guide when necessary.</p>
	<p>Please click on each individual section, which will explain how to do each type of project with examples. This website is a complete transmedia storytelling project for your classroom--a guide for you to follow. That being said, please feel free to use these same concepts and ideas for other stories, topics, or themes.</p>
	<p>As it is, this project is best suited for 4th and 5th grade. Topic can be adjusted for higher grade levels. Transmedia concepts would have to be altered to suit lower grade levels.</p>
